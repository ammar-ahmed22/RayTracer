# Raytracer

Graphics rendering raytracer created with C++ as a learning exercise.
Utilized the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.

Hyper-realistic looking scenes can be rendered with a positionable camera with focus and aperture abilities. At the moment,
only spheres can be rendered with various materials that have various properties.
